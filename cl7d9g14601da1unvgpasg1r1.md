## What IT course to study for Bachelor's Degree?

# Intro

Let's talk about people's craze for choosing the "right" course to study IT as an undergraduate. 

I get a lot of messages from people asking what would be best for them. I will try to answer them here.

### 1. Is academics really important for getting into a software development job?

Short answer: No. But maybe...??

Long answer: If you want to work in a well-paying job and keep getting better at what you do, a degree is not required. You will learn things in college but it might not be enough for you to get going. So, prepare a plan for learning what you want to do. If you are not sure about that then, try a few things and pick what clicks for you. There are a lot of companies who do not care what you studied at college or if you even went to college at all. Having said that, we can not deny the fact that a lot of jobs still require a degree so, you might wanna pursue one maybe just to be on the safe side [it's completely up to you]. Also, have very less expectations from your college. Almost all colleges only focus on making you a good student. The gap between academics and the real world is really big and that's what you yourself should build a bridge for. 

### 2. Is studying IT abroad better than studying in Nepal?

Short Answer: Well, yes. But, there is a catch.

Long Answer: If you got into a well-known university and a good scholarship or your parents can fulfill all the fees, go for it. It's not just about the college and curriculum but the environment you will be on. But, if you need to work your ass off just to pay your university fees then seriously, reconsider. Skills are more important than a degree in this field and if you have to work a time-consuming job and handle your college both at the same time then, you will have no time to learn anything. 
With the internet on your side, you can learn anything nowadays so, do research and get into learning as soon as you can. 

### 4. XYZ course v/s ABC course?

Short Answer: Cheaper one is better.

Long Answer: Seriously, all the courses are very similar to each other and you are after all going to have to learn stuff on your own so, the cheaper one is better. If you have any specific interests then look at the curriculum and choose.

### 3. Which is the best college for XYZ course?

Short Answer: The nearby government college from where you live.

Long Answer: [Whatever is stated above]. And, there also are a few things that you would want to consider. One is the timing, try to avoid day classes as it will eat almost your whole day and you won't have much time to learn and work. And another thing is the attendance requirement. Achieving 80% attendance is really tough for people who work. So, talk with seniors and pass out students about the situation of the college.

### 4. What course did you study, where, and why?

Short answer: Information Management at Shanker Dev Campus because I am interested in management and the business side of things, as well.

Long answer: I have been keen on business and economics since I was of young age. And I have been a tech enthusiast since I remember using a computer. I looked for courses that would be good for me and I figured, BIM is a good choice. And, I chose SDC because it was cheap.


Lastly, do not believe whatever that guy on the internet tells you [not even me]. Do what you think is good for you. There is no right answer. 
I am not trying to feed my opinion into you. These are mere suggestions from the top of my head.

I would love to hear your thoughts as well.
Thanks and best wishes.
